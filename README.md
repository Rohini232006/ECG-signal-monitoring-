ECG Signal Monitoring measures the electrical activity of the heart using electrodes attached to the body. The signals are amplified and processed by a microcontroller to display the heartâ€™s rhythm on an LCD or computer. It helps in detecting irregularities, arrhythmias, and provides real-time cardiac health monitoring for patients.
